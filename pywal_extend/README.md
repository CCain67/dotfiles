# Pywal Extend

This folder contains the python script which takes a color scheme generated by pywal and applies it to the applications/webpages I use frequently. Specifically, this script updates:

* The colors for the pdf reader Zathura
* The colors for many different websites: nlab, wikipedia (through Wikiwand), various stack exchange sites, personal firefox homepage, and jupyter notebooks. This is done through the UserContent.css file.
* The file explorer (Dolphin).

The first two are especially helpful for working at night.

Note: some of these may be outdated, since tweaking css is (for me) a long process...
