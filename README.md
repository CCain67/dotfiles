# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles (config files) for my current workflow. Some features include:

* minimal, distraction free interface
* "global" coor schemes - includes a python script which applies color schemes generated by ```pywal``` to all main applications I use
* self assembling - in the sense that there is a bash script which installs all of the necessary packages and places the dotfiles in the corresponding directories.
* my custom build of the Iosevka font, Whyosevka

More info on the scripts is given in their respective READMEs.
